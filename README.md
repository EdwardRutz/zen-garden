## [X] The Zen Garden Challenge

Use CSS to format the Zen Garden Challenge.

For the Zen Garden design went with a retro, black & white newspaper look.

- All of your work should be on a branch, NOT on master. 
	- [X] To do this, create a branch called "exercise"

## Requirements

- [X] Visit http://www.csszengarden.com/ and explore some of the designs.

You will create your own version of the CSS Zen Garden.

- [X] Download the HTML and CSS files.  
	:paperclip: [HTML](http://www.csszengarden.com/examples/index)  
	:paperclip: [CSS](http://www.csszengarden.com/examples/style.css)  

- [X] Copy the contents of the HTML file into your `index.html`.  
- [X] Copy the contents of the CSS file into your `styles.css`.  

> The only rule: you may only change the CSS; not the HTML.

- [X] When your work is complete, 
	- add, commit, and push up the branch (`git push origin exercise`). 
	- Then submit a pull request on Github.

> :pencil2:  In an effort to keep this project like the Zen Garden website, this exercise does not have a styles folder.
